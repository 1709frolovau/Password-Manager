# Password-Manager

This is a simple Password Manager I created using C++. It stores passwords by encrypting them using a basic XOR cipher method before being saved and uses user friendly CLI for easy interaction.

Used skills:
·file handling
·basic encryption
·STL
·classes and encapsulation
·CLI

Future plans:
·replace XOR with stronger cipher method
·create a GUI

!!! This project is for learning purposes only and CANNOT be used as real password storage due to security reasons.
